/// An abstract class that defines the contract for all repositories.
///
/// This class acts as an abstraction layer between the application's business
/// logic and the data sources. Its purpose is to encapsulate the logic for
/// fetching and updating data, regardless of where the data originates
/// (e.g., a local database, a remote API, or a cache). By adhering to this
/// interface, the application's use cases and services remain independent of
/// the underlying data implementation details.

  /// and returns it as a [UserEntity].

  ///
  /// This method handles the logic for persisting changes to a user's data.
