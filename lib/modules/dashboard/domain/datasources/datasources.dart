/// This class acts as a blueprint for implementing different data access
/// layers, such as local databases, remote APIs, or mock data. It ensures
/// that all data sources provide a consistent set of methods for interacting
/// with user and vital signs data. This abstraction allows the repository
/// layer to be independent of the specific data source implementation.
